This repository holds the source code that Eceborg's main robot was running during the 2017 edition of the french robotic cup (eurobot).
Eceborg is a student association at the french engineer school ECE Paris.
This project was part of our curriculum and involved several person during one year.
Due to electronics issues, we could ne score as many points as expected and we finished 90 out of 122 teams.

Take a look at the `Doc/` folder for plain english documentation. You can also take a look at the header files in `Deoxys/Galib/` for more technical details.
